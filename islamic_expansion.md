This timeline encapsulates the rapid expansion of Islam from its origins in the Arabian Peninsula, through the conquests of Persian and Byzantine territories, and into the Iberian Peninsula, culminating in the counter-response of the First Crusade. This period was marked by significant military, cultural, and religious shifts that have shaped the subsequent course of world history.

### Conquest of Africa

The Islamic expansion into North Africa, preceding the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, is a crucial phase in Islamic history. Here's a detailed overview of these territorial gains:

### 7th Century: Initial Conquests

- **642 CE**: Following the conquest of Egypt, Muslims, under the command of Amr ibn al-As, begin expanding westward into North Africa.
- **643-647 CE**: Islamic forces make initial incursions into Libya, encountering resistance from Byzantine and Berber forces.
- **647 CE**: A significant military expedition is sent under the command of Abdullah ibn Saad, reaching as far west as Tripoli in modern-day Libya.

### Mid-7th Century: Consolidation and Resistance

- **650s-660s CE**: Despite early advances, Muslim control remains limited to coastal regions due to stiff resistance from Berber tribes in the interior regions.
- **670 CE**: Establishment of the city of Kairouan in present-day Tunisia. It becomes a key center for Islamic governance and learning in North Africa.

### Late 7th Century: Further Expansion

- **688-698 CE**: The Muslims, under Umayyad Caliphate rule, launch renewed campaigns in North Africa.
- **698 CE**: Fall of Carthage. The Byzantine stronghold of Carthage falls to the Muslims, marking a significant strategic and symbolic victory.

### 8th Century: Completion of Conquest

- **711 CE**: Crossing of the Strait of Gibraltar. Tariq ibn Ziyad leads his forces into the Iberian Peninsula, marking the beginning of Islamic rule in Spain.

### Key Points

- **Berber Involvement**: Initially resistant to Islamic expansion, many Berber tribes gradually convert to Islam and become integral to further conquests in North Africa and Iberia.
- **Strategic Importance**: North Africa served as a springboard for further Islamic expansion into Europe and was vital for controlling the western Mediterranean.
- **Cultural and Religious Impact**: The conquests facilitated the spread of Islamic culture and the Arabic language in North Africa.

These events highlight the gradual and strategic nature of Islamic expansion in North Africa, characterized by initial resistance, followed by consolidation, and eventual integration into the Islamic world. This expansion laid the groundwork for the subsequent Islamic presence in the Iberian Peninsula and significantly influenced the cultural and political landscape of the Mediterranean region.
